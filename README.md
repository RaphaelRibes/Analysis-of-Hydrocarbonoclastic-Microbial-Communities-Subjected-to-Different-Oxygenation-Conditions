# Analysis of Hydrocarbonoclastic Microbial Communities Subjected to Different Oxygenation Conditions

## Abstract
This internship report presents the analysis of hydrocarbonoclastic microbial communities subjected to various 
oxygenation conditions, as part of research conducted at IPREM. The main objective is to develop and apply 
biostatistical and bioinformatics tools to analyze and characterize these microbial communities, 
focusing on sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and denitrifying bacteria (DB). 
Three distinct microbial communities were incubated in bioreactors under conditions of permanent anoxic, 
permanent oxic, and anoxic/oxic oscillations. Sequencing data, processed with Qiime2 and statistically analyzed with 
Python, show that oxygenation conditions significantly influence community structure. DBs adapt better to oscillating 
conditions, while the abundance of SRBs decreases after oxygenation. The expression of dsrB genes and the relative 
abundance of ASVs indicate that certain bacteria, such as Sulfurimonas and Marinobacter, play crucial roles in these 
environments. These results provide important insights into the dynamics of microbial communities and their role in 
the bioremediation of contaminated marine sediments.
